as by hashtag seach is only at one place that too show only posts not comment

-> can search for posts than contains hashtag - implies that hastags in the post
caption are modeled in the db

-> can't seach for comments or users with a hashtag - implies they are not modeled 
(or we don't have to )

that's why we are considering to create table for post hashtags only reset comment/user hashtag
we are not worrying as those are not searchable from anywhere


-> using hastag_post_2(ref-img), we might end up duplicating the same hashtag multiple times
so to avoid performance degradation we will go with diff. hashtag table approach

-> in hashtag_post_final & hashtag_final (ref-> img), we can save one table for hashtag
so there would not be repetetion


* In USERS table we are not storing the post count as well as follower count
=>  as getting post & follower from db query is very simple
=> and that would change most oftenly
=> so this type of data can be calculated by running the simple query
=> we call this 'derived data' we generally don't want to store derived data
=> until there is huge performance benefit or running query to get these is very complex

- as we can see in the both the case caption and photo tag ultimate goal is to tag user 
and redirect to user details when we click on it.

- If we know in both the tags we need to do the same thing and field would also be then
go with (2nd)approach

- we can go with 1st(final) approach if we need to query caption tags 10 time more
more frequently than like table then better to go with 1st(final) approach of creating
separate table

- will the meaning of photo tags would have more option then 1st(final) approach is better
